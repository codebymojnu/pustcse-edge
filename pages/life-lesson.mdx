The man👨🏽‍🦱doesn’t know that there is a snake 🐍underneath.

The woman🙍🏽‍♀️doesn’t know that there is a stone crushing the man.
The woman 🙎🏼‍♀️thinks: “I am going to fall! And I can’t climb because the snake 🐍is going to bite me! Why can’t the man 🧔🏼use a little more strength and pull me up!” The man 🧑🏾‍🦲thinks: “I am in so much pain! Yet I’m still pulling you as much as I can! Why don’t you try and climb a little harder!?”

The moral is lesson—

 you can’t see the pressure the other person is under, and the other person can’t see the pain you’re in.
This is life, whether it’s with work, family, feelings or friends, we should try to understand each other.

Learn to think differently, perhaps more clearly and communicate better. A little thought and patience goes a long way.
